### List of solved tasks

* [Counting DNA Nucleotides](Counting_DNA_Nucleotides.py) -  the function that counts the nucleotides present in the given DNA sequence.
* [Transcribing DNA into RNA](Transcribing_DNA_into_RNA.py) - the function that transcribed DNA sequence into RNA sequence. 
* [Complementing a Strand of DNA](Complementing_Strand_of_DNA.py) - the function that outputs the reverse complement of the given DNA sequence.
* [Mendel's First Law](Mendels_first_law.py) - the function that returns the probability that two randomly selected mating organisms will produce an individual possessing a dominant allele.
